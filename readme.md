### what is this?

> Russian roulette (Russian: Русская рулетка, romanized: Russkaya ruletka) is a
> potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in
> a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body
> (of the opponent or themselves), and pulls the trigger. If the loaded chamber
> aligns with the barrel, the weapon will fire, killing or severely injuring
> the player.

translating this into a fun computer game, we prompt the user to guess a number
between 1 and 10 and wipe their hard drive if they get the guess wrong :)
